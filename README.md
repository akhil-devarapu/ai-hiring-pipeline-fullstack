# AI-Powered Hiring Pipeline (CrewAI Version)

An intelligent hiring system that uses **CrewAI agents** to evaluate candidates through multiple stages with comprehensive analysis and 80% threshold scoring.

## ðŸš€ **New: CrewAI Implementation**

This project now uses **CrewAI** - a powerful framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents. The system maintains all existing functionalities while leveraging specialized AI agents for each stage of the hiring process.

### **CrewAI Agents:**

1. **Resume Screening Agent** - Evaluates candidate fit and initial screening
2. **Coding Assessment Agent** - Creates and evaluates coding tests
3. **Technical Interview Agent** - Conducts technical interviews
4. **HR Interview Agent** - Assesses cultural fit and professionalism
5. **Offer Letter Agent** - Generates professional offer letters

## ðŸ”§ **Recent Fixes and Improvements**

### **Fixed Issues:**
- âœ… **Link Usage Logic**: Fixed the issue where links were marked as used immediately upon access. Now links are only marked as completed after the test/interview is finished.
- âœ… **CrewAI Agent Integration**: Improved agent configuration and result parsing with proper error handling.
- âœ… **Fallback Mode**: Added comprehensive fallback functionality when CrewAI is not available.
- âœ… **Flow Continuity**: Ensured proper flow through all stages (coding test â†’ technical interview â†’ HR interview â†’ offer letter).
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for all CrewAI operations with graceful fallbacks.

### **Key Improvements:**
- **Robust Agent System**: Each agent now has proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Better Result Parsing**: Improved JSON parsing for CrewAI results with multiple fallback strategies
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now retake tests if they fail, and completed tests show results
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Email Integration**: Improved email sending with proper error handling
